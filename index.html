1. Watch the demo. (http://nu.bootcampcontent.com/NU-Coding

2. You're going to make a game jsut like the one in the video. 
   Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user 
   has to guess which letter the app chose.  Put the following 
   text on your page:
3. Guess what letter I'm thinking of
4. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
5. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter 
   correctly after exhausting all guesses)
6. Guesses Left: (# of guess left.  This will update)
7. Your guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user 
   typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start 
   the game over again (without refershing the page).
9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and 
   restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the 
   user wins).
